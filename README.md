# Sports Field Finder
## By: Yatri Patel and Kush Patel
### Overview:
This project uses Flask as a backend service and HTML, CSS, & JavaScript for the front end. Some of the initial difficulties we faced were in how to use Flask itself. We watched numerous tutorials together and consulted a friend who had experience to better understand, and from there we saw that a large part of the problem was not using the pip feature. Additionally, we learned about the ability to create a Txt file that would help to configure the setup for anyone trying to run the project and they would simply install all of the mandatory libraries and programs needed in the Txt file to ensure that they are able to run the program. Overall, working with the backend was a hard but really rewarding experience as we learned a great ordeal of how websites truly function behind just the front page, and how difficult it can be to manage them. For the front end of the website, we used a majority of HTML to construct the website. When creating the front end, we used a variety of online sources to understand how to create the front end while using HTML. We also used the CSS aspect in the website by creating the business card feature. This was a bit challenging to figure out, however, we were able to use online resources to make sure the website was properly constructed. Some portions of the website also included javascript which we also utilized with the help of online resources to create the website.
